Don't hold onto things that require a thight grip.
I didn't come this far to only come this far.
Vulnerability sounds like faith and looks like courage.
And into the forest I go to lose my mind and find my soul.
Do it scared.
Look how far you've come.
Each time you break your own.
Sitting in silence with you.
