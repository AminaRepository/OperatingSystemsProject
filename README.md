# OperatingSystemsProject
A repository compiling all my code for my Operating Systems project

file describing my project:

Purpose: The purpose of this project is to familiarize you with the mechanics of process control
through the implementation of a shell user interface. This includes the relationship between
child and parent processes, the steps needed to create a new process, shell variables, and an
introduction to user-input parsing and verification.

Task 1.1: The shell (command line) is just a program that continually asks for user input,
perhaps does something on the userâ€™s behalf, resets itself, and again asks for user input. Design
and implement a basic shell interface that supports the execution of other programs and a
series of built-in functions. The shell should be robust (e.g., it should not crash under any
circumstance beyond machine failure).

Basic: The prompt should look like this:
prompt$
Advanced: The prompt should look like this:
machinename@username:~$
Where machinename and username should change depending on the machine and user.

Task 1.2: Shell programs/commands.

Basic: Implement the basic functionality of the following programs: cp, history, free,
fortune.
Intermediate: Provide a few options and/or arguments for at least two programs. Additional
points for creativity (e.g. implementing something that does not exist in bash, or differently than
it is done in bash).
Advanced: Allow piping or at least redirecting output to a text file.

Task 1.3: System calls.

Basic: Within the C-programming example of your choice, implement the following system calls:
fork(), wait(), and exec().
Intermediate: Within the C-programming example of your choice, implement rfork(),
execlp().
Additionally: Carefully explore and then implement the forkbomb.

Task 1.4: Add some colors to your shell and name.

Task 1.5: Provide a concise and descriptive answer to the following questions.

Q1: Do the following actions require the OS to use kernel mode or user mode is sufficient?
Explain.
1. A program wants to read from disk.
2. Reading the current time from the hardware clock.
Q2: Explain the purpose of a system call. There are different sets of system calls: list them and
give at least 2 examples of a system call for each category.
