In this part of the project, first we are going to write a simple code 
as an example of the mmap and munmap system calls. The code is in the
file memory.c, and simply allocates and the deallocates memory using
said system calls.

For the second part, we will make a programm that runs infinitely and
measure the memory used. That task code is found in the file memory2.c and
has a simple program that counts from one to ten repeadetly, and every
three seconds it prints out memory usage.

The third part is the same program but adjusted so that we map an empty
page from the OS. That task is found in the file memory3.c
The memory allocated is bigger than previously as we need additional
memory to account for memory mapping.

For the fourth and final part, the code is in the file memory4.c
The memory allocated increases yet again as it needs to accomodate both for
the empty page mapped as well as the data entry.
